Building QjSimple under Mac OS X
================================
(provided by Daniel-Constantin Mierla)

Mac OS X version used is: 10.10.1 (Yosemite)

1) pjsip 1.x
------------

	- install macports to add the dependencies
	- pjsip uses portaudio and libssl development files to support TLS and SRTP

sudo port install portaudio
sudo port install openssl

	- pjsip - latest 1.x at the time of writing this guidelines was 1.16:

wget http://www.pjsip.org/release/1.16/pjproject-1.16.tar.bz2

tar xfvj pjproject-1.16.tar.bz2
ln -s pjproject-1.16 pjproject
cd pjproject-1.16
./configure

	- after configure add next lines to the file pjlib/include/pj/config_site.h:

        #define PJSIP_HAS_TLS_TRANSPORT 1
        #define PJ_HAS_IPV6 1
        #define PJSIP_MAX_PKT_LEN 10000

	- build using the commands

make dep
make


Now PJSIP is build as static libraries, wich are used to link to by QjSimple

2) QT Toolkit
-------------

	- install the Qt5 SDK (Community Edition) for Mac OS X 10.10:

http://www.qt.io/download/

3) QjSimple
-----------

	- open QjSimple project in QT Creator
	- edit QjSimple.pro file and update the path for PjSIP include and library
	  directories, if you made the symbolic link 'pjproject' to the
	  'pkproject-1.16', then no change should be done.

	* the parts that might need update are the CPU architecture (x86_64) and
	  the version (14.0.0), you can see them by checking one of the libraries
	  in pjproject directory, like:

~# ls pjproject/pjlib/lib/

libpj-i386-apple-darwin14.0.0.a

or:

libpj-x86_64-apple-darwin14.0.0.a

	* it happened that the 'uname -a' shows CPU x86_64, but the 'uname -p'
	  returned 'i386'. If the Mac OS X is configured for x86_64, in case
	  you get errors compiling QjSimple, go to pjproject folder, edit
	  config.guess, search for '-apple-darwin' and replace 'uname -p' with
	  'uname -m', like:

  echo `uname -m`-apple-darwin${UNAME_RELEASE}

    * edit again QjSimple.pro, find the variable 'macx:LIBS' and update
      the name of the PjSIP libraries to match i386 or x86_64 as they were
      built in the pjproject directory. The default are the name of the libs
      with i386, so change it to x86_64 if needed.

4) QHttp in Qt5
---------------

QHttp was made obsolete and removed from Qt5, you have to install it as add-on
via https://qt.gitorious.org/qt:

  git clone https://gitorious.org/qt/qthttp.git
  cd qthttp
  qmake
  make (or nmake or mingw32-make or whatever)
  make install (nmake install, mingw32-make install, â€¦)

Generic notes (for reference, done in QjSimple):
  - in the .pro file of the project, add QT += http
  - un qmake on your project
  - compile your project
